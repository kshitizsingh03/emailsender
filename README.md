# Email Sender Script

This Python script enables you to send emails using the Gmail SMTP server. It allows you to send plain-text emails by providing your Gmail credentials, the recipient's email address, a subject, and the email body.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure the following:
1. You have Python installed on your system (Python 3.6 or later recommended).
2. You have access to a Gmail account.
3. You have created an **App Password** for your Gmail account. (Google requires this for less-secure app access.)
